## Introduction

`babynames` describes the popularity of different children names as recorded by the United States Social Security Administration. The data set contains five variables:

-   `name` - A name

-   `year` - A year

-   `sex` - A biological sex (`"F"` = Female, `"M"` = Male)

-   `n` - The *number* of children of that sex who were given that name in that year

-   `prop` - The *proportion* of children of that sex who were given that name in that yearRunning Code

```{r}
#install required packages

install.packages("tidyverse")

```

load libraries to use

```{r}
# load libraries to use
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(babynames)

```

Exploration 01:

-   How many names are in babynames data set?

-   what years does babynames cover?

-   Does `babynames` include *every* name or just the ones that meet a certain cutoff?

```{r}
#investigate the structure of our data
str(babynames)

View(babynames)


baby_data <- babynames |> 
    summarize(
        n_names = n_distinct(name),
        min_n = min(n),
        first_year = min(year),
        last_year = max(year)
    ) 
baby_data

```

## observation:

babynames includes every name given to at least five children of each sex between the years 1880 and 2017.

Babynames is a fascinating data set because it allows us to research trends in how Americans name their children.

Exploration 02: can we find out the most popular boys names in 2017, sorted by n?

```{r}
pop_boy_names <- babynames |> 
    filter(year == 2017, sex == "M") %>% 
    arrange(desc(n))

pop_boy_names

```

Exploration 03:

we can also look at the all-time most popular names. For instance all-time most popular girls when we sum the number of girls who have been given each name over the years.

```{r}
most_popular_girls <- babynames |>  
    filter(sex == "F") |>  
    group_by(name) |>  
    summarize(
        total_n = sum(n),
    ) |> 
    arrange(desc(total_n))

head(most_popular_girls)


```

what about the most popular boys when we sum the number of boys who have been giveb each name over the years

```{r}
most_popular_boys <- babynames |> 
  filter(sex == "M") |> 
  group_by(name) |> 
  summarize(
    total_n = sum(n),
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(total_n))
  
head(most_popular_boys)

```

Exploration 04:

John is one of the all-time most popular boys names, even though John did not appear in the top 10 most popular boys names for 2017. Did it recently drop off in popularity?

Letâ€™s use a graph to investigate the history of the name John

```{r}
babynames %>% 
  filter(sex != "F", name == "John" | name == "James", na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = prop, color = name)) + 
    geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "History of the name John and James",
    caption = "Source: Full baby name data provided by the SSA"
  )

```

Exploration 05:

we can visualize the number of children born in the United States for each year

```{r}
babynames %>% 
  group_by(year, sex) %>% 
  summarize(
    births = sum(n)
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = births, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Estimated births by year",
    caption = "Source: Full baby name data provided by the SSA"
    ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
